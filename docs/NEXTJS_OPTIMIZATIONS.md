# Next.js Optimizations

This document outlines the various optimizations implemented in our Next.js configuration to improve performance, reduce bundle size, and enhance the development experience.

## Bundle Size Optimizations

### 1. Lodash Optimization

We've implemented several strategies to optimize Lodash imports and reduce bundle size:

- **Individual Function Imports**: We enforce importing specific Lodash functions instead of the entire library.
- **Lodash-ES for Tree Shaking**: We use `lodash-es` for better tree shaking in client bundles.

For more details, see [LODASH_OPTIMIZATION.md](./LODASH_OPTIMIZATION.md).

### 2. Modular React Imports

We've configured webpack to use modular imports for React components:

```javascript
config.resolve.alias = {
  ...config.resolve.alias,
  'react/jsx-runtime': 'react/jsx-runtime.js',
  'react/jsx-dev-runtime': 'react/jsx-dev-runtime.js',
};
```

This ensures that only the necessary React components are included in the bundle.

### 3. SWC Minification

We've enabled SWC minification for better and faster code minification:

```javascript
swcMinify: true,
```

SWC is a Rust-based compiler that is significantly faster than Terser for minification.

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Image Optimization

We've configured Next.js to optimize images for better performance:

```javascript
images: {
  formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
  unoptimized: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
},
```

- **AVIF and WebP Support**: We prioritize modern image formats for better compression.
- **Development Optimization**: We disable image optimization in development for faster builds.

### 2. Console Removal in Production

We remove console statements in production builds to reduce bundle size and improve performance:

```javascript
compiler: {
  removeConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
},
```

### 3. Standalone Output

We use the standalone output option for better deployment performance:

```javascript
output: 'standalone',
```

This creates a standalone build that includes all dependencies, making deployment easier and more reliable.

### 4. Experimental Features

We've enabled several experimental features for better performance:

```javascript
experimental: {
  optimisticClientCache: true,
  serverActions: {
    bodySizeLimit: '2mb',
  },
},
```

- **Optimistic Client Cache**: Improves navigation performance by optimistically caching pages.
- **Server Actions**: Enables more efficient server-side operations.

## Development Experience

### 1. React Strict Mode

We've enabled React Strict Mode for better development experience:

```javascript
reactStrictMode: true,
```

This helps identify potential problems in the application during development.

### 2. Source Maps

We've disabled production source maps to reduce bundle size:

```javascript
productionBrowserSourceMaps: false,
```

Enable this option if you need to debug production issues.

## Measuring Impact

To measure the impact of these optimizations, you can use the following tools:

1. **Next.js Bundle Analyzer**: Run `ANALYZE=true pnpm build` to visualize your bundle size.
2. **Lighthouse**: Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to measure performance improvements.
3. **Web Vitals**: Monitor Core Web Vitals in production to track real-world performance.

## Further Optimizations

Consider implementing these additional optimizations:

1. **Dynamic Imports**: Use dynamic imports for code splitting.
2. **Preload Critical Assets**: Use `next/head` to preload critical assets.
3. **Font Optimization**: Use `next/font` for optimized font loading.
4. **Incremental Static Regeneration**: Use ISR for data-heavy pages.
5. **Edge Runtime**: Consider using the Edge Runtime for API routes that need to be globally distributed.
