# Webhook Testing Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the webhook testing infrastructure in the Emoji Map project. The focus was on organizing fixtures and creating reusable helpers for testing Clerk webhooks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Centralized Webhook Fixtures

- Created a centralized location for webhook fixtures in the `src/__tests__/helpers/clerk-webhook-helpers.ts` file.
- Defined standard fixtures for user creation and user update events.
- Made fixtures easily accessible through a common interface.

### 2. Created Reusable Testing Helpers

- Implemented `mockClerkWebhook` function to consistently mock Svix webhook verification.
- Created `createClerkWebhookHandler` function to simulate webhook handler behavior in tests.
- Added proper TypeScript typing for mocked Prisma client.

### 3. Updated Test Files

- Updated `route.update.test.ts` to use the new helpers and fixtures.
- Updated `route.create.test.ts` to use the new helpers and fixtures.
- Updated `route.test.ts` to use the new helpers and fixtures.

### 4. Fixed Import Issues

- Resolved issues with importing JSON fixtures by defining them directly in the helper file.
- Fixed typo in Google Places fixture path in `setup.ts`.

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: All webhook tests now use the same fixtures and mocking approach.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to webhook structure only need to be updated in one place.
- **Readability**: Tests are more focused on assertions rather than setup.
- **Reliability**: Tests are less likely to break due to changes in the webhook structure.

## Remaining Issues

While the webhook tests are now passing, there are still some issues with the places-nearby-v2.test.ts file:

1. **Cache Key Testing**: The test expects redis.get to be called with a string parameter, but it's being called with undefined.
2. **Empty Results**: Several tests expect results to be returned, but the places array is empty.
3. **MaxResults Parameter**: The test for maxResults parameter expects exactly 1 result, but 0 are returned.

These issues are related to the fixture data structure and the way the API route is being tested. They should be addressed separately.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining issues in the places-nearby-v2.test.ts file.
2. Consider creating similar helper functions for other API tests.
3. Update the documentation to reflect the new testing approach.
