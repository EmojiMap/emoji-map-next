# Testing Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the testing infrastructure of the Emoji Map project. The goal was to create a more reliable and maintainable testing setup, particularly for handling external API calls and ensuring tests are isolated from each other.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created API Response Fixtures

We created fixtures for our API responses in the `src/__fixtures__/api` directory. These fixtures provide consistent test data for our API tests:

- `src/__fixtures__/api/health/response.json`: Health API response
- `src/__fixtures__/api/places/nearby/response.json`: Places Nearby API response
- `src/__fixtures__/api/places/details/response.json`: Places Details API response
- `src/__fixtures__/api/places/v2/response.json`: Places V2 API response
- `src/__fixtures__/api/webhooks/success-response.json`: Webhook success response

### 2. Updated MSW Setup

We updated the `src/__tests__/setup.ts` file to:

- Remove the global fetch mock that was interfering with our MSW handlers
- Export the server and handlers, but not start the server by default
- Define handlers for both external and internal API routes

### 3. Created API Test Helpers

We created a helper file `src/__tests__/helpers/api-test-helpers.ts` to:

- Set up MSW servers for our tests
- Define handlers for our API routes
- Provide a consistent way to mock API responses

### 4. Updated Test Files

We updated several test files to use our new API test helpers:

- `src/__tests__/api/health/health-integration.test.ts`
- `src/__tests__/api/health/health-with-base-url.test.ts`
- `src/__tests__/api/health/health-with-utility.test.ts`
- `src/__tests__/api/webhooks/route.update.test.ts`

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Webhook Tests

The webhook tests are still failing because:

- There are linter errors in the mock database setup
- The mock database is not properly set up to match the expected structure

### 2. Places API Tests

The places API tests are failing because:

- The response data doesn't match what the tests expect
- The tests are using a different structure for the API responses

### 3. Redis Cache Tests

The Redis cache tests are failing because:

- The tests are expecting specific cache keys and values
- The mock Redis client is not properly set up

## Next Steps

1. Fix the webhook tests by properly mocking the database
2. Update the places API tests to match the expected response structure
3. Fix the Redis cache tests by properly mocking the Redis client
4. Update the remaining test files to use our new API test helpers

## Best Practices

1. **Use MSW for API Mocking**: Use MSW to mock API responses instead of mocking fetch directly
2. **Create Fixtures for Test Data**: Create fixtures for test data to ensure consistency
3. **Isolate Tests**: Ensure tests are isolated from each other by using separate MSW servers
4. **Use Test Helpers**: Create test helpers to reduce duplication and improve maintainability
5. **Mock External Dependencies**: Mock external dependencies like databases and Redis to ensure tests are isolated
