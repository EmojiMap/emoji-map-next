Although the place is really not bad, it cannot be called unsurpassed. However, if you are in New York, you should visit this place at least once to try the insanely famous pizza slices.

The pizzeria is very popular, especially because of its location on Broadway. Given this, in the evening, you need to be prepared for a long line - during our visit, it stretched for an entire street to the next intersection, moving at an average speed.

It was very cozy inside, with a really cool atmosphere. Despite the large number of visitors, we even managed to find a seat and enjoy the pizza inside. We ordered three different slices of pizza (pepperoni, regular cheese, and cheese with extra mozzarella), all of which were large and fresh. As for the taste, I can say that the pizza was standard tasty without any special features, but not the best you can find in New York. There are many lesser-known pizzerias on the streets where you can buy a similar pizza at a lower price, and it tastes and is identical in size.
A nice bonus was the opportunity to add extra Parmesan or other spices for free.

To summarize, it is worth visiting Joe’s Pizza at least once while in New York, if only because of the incredible atmosphere of the place. However, I would not recommend wasting time waiting in line for a piece of pizza again, as the city offers many other places with a variety of delicious food.', '2025-03-27 05:01:38.364', '2025-03-27 05:01:38.364'),

My college friend (a local) recommended this as his favorite pizza spot in NYC after trying many places, and I can see why.

We shared three slices - the Margherita, The New Yorker, and a pesto and sausage white slice. The crust was perfectly thin and crispy with amazing structural integrity when folded - no drooping! For the first time ever, I actually wanted to finish the crust, not just the part with toppings. The red sauce was exceptional and the slices were generously sized.

There''s a line out the door (be prepared to know your order when you reach the counter), and they call your name when your slices are ready. Inside is packed but they have plenty of bar counters for standing while you eat.

Possibly the best pizza I''ve ever had and exactly what I imagined authentic NYC pizza should be. My wife''s favorite was the pesto slice, while I loved them all equally. Definitely a must-visit for pizza lovers!', '2025-03-27 05:42:46.602', '2025-03-27 05:42:46.602'),

I had heard a lot of good things about the place, so maybe I just happened to catch them on a bad day. For starters, the bathrooms were out of order, which was a bit frustrating.

I ordered my food to-go, and when I got it, the pizza was burnt and, to my surprise, a bit cold. Considering all the hype, I was expecting much better quality. The pricing is also a bit on the high side, especially for a regular slice — I’ve had better for less.

On the plus side, they are one of the few pizza spots that offer sparkling water, which I really appreciated. Parking in the area can be tricky, but the metered parking is much cheaper than it is in other parts of NYC, so that’s a small win.

I’m willing to give Industry Pizza a second chance since it might have just been an off day, but based on this experience, it didn’t quite live up to the expectations.', '2025-03-27 05:42:46.602', '2025-03-27 05:42:46.602'),

It wasn’t bad, however this is definitely the kind of location where you want to ask for half chicken half steak for your bowl cause they’re skimpy. I saw them make a burrito for the girl in front of me and I literally felt bad for how little that thing was. But anyways, if you don’t want to get scammed make sure they’re adding 2 rice scoops and then specify that you want half of one meat and half of another. It sucks to play mind games with them but her scoops were nice so I’m just glad I got what I wanted. My friend did steak and she only got one scoop🙁, not even heaping. They did get me with the guacamole tho. Make sure you tell them that LAST because they will put it in the middle even if you mention it lastly. I got nervous and just told her everything I wanted on it and she was the one to decide what order the ingradients went on so next time trust I will be acting like I’d ALMOST forgotten the guac for extra measure.

upon entering we were greeted warmly and immediately seated it was a slow night for them on a Friday night but then again you do not just walk into this place without at least $100 a person to really enjoy all they have to offer

so the buffet all you can eat that''s about 60 bucks a person then of course they include 20% gratuity automatically cover your waiter

so I was gifted two gift cards to this place and they were very respectfully able to quickly just confirm and look up the balances on those gift cards and confirm I have learned just a hard way in the past always make sure when you are gifted something just double check before you even start the actual balance you were told is done to gift cards is actually on the gift cards

we immediately received it they took care of us they got us immediately drinks and they have by the way lots of drink options both alcoholic and non-alcoholic

My mom got a nice sparkly water with plenty of lime and a fancy wine glass

they accommodated me and got me hot water with lemons and lots and lots of hot water and lemons throughout the night which hit the spot I''m a huge fan of especially this time of season hot water and lemons!

by the way nothing here is cheap even the lemons and limes I could tell were organic fresh

immediately got us some rolls which I declined to save my appetite as a new I was coming here for the meat the meat and did I mention the meat!

they quickly got our plates got us a little cards did you flip like you do with all Brazilian steak places you''ve lifted up green to let the person know you''re still wanting more and let the person who comes by know if you want but you have to offer or not

And this night I tried over a dozen different variations of beef before finally getting to the lamb and I can tell you right now this place hit the spot and every way imaginable on the pallet

also they have a bar area for those that want to sip on any number of a thousand different variations of wine to have here this is one of their specialties to have wine to appease just about everybody''s pallet I can imagine

but this night I did not come for wine I came for meat!

and to treat my mom out who enjoyed all you can eat salad bar that was a part of the $60 price

My mom later don''t shared to see regretted maybe getting a little too much from the salad bar not more the meats!

so you got all variation kinds of shrimp pork chicken wrapped in pork chicken that by the way just even just get the chicken leg not wrapped in chicken that''s like marinated and honey and melts in your mouth the meat was literally some of the best chicken I''ve ever eaten in my entire life and that''s saying something

also they brought us some different sauces to try and I can tell you I loved all of them

lots of handicap options lots of options for the kids and also fancy men''s and women''s restrooms.

The lamb chops are the best ever I''ve ever a tasted in my entire life melted in my mouth highly recommend them!
Lamb steak was also amazing!

beef ribs or melt in your mouth with that just perfect combination of marination of just combination of seasonings and freshness and that charcoal that I love the mouth aftertaste

they had a orange sauce that''s sort of like a Chipotle but with a kick perfect my all-time favorite had to bring me multiples of it marinated just about everything in that stuff and sucked it up off my plate was absolutely delicious

also they''re green Verde salsa verde sauce was phenomenal with the lovely after kick burned it up

also did I mention I live dangerously hot so they brought me fresh cooked peppers with onions marinated and spices the light by a mouth on fire and every way imaginable to go with my food :-D

My mom opted for the flavorful and got lots of the tomatillo sauce which was phenomenal as well and goes with just about everything but a combination of flavors.

Also nothing came off as extra salty everything came off it''s just high quality & everyone here works as a team phenomenal service!', '2025-03-28 01:43:27.305', '2025-03-28 01:43:27.305'),

The day after flying into Denver, Cassey, Caleb and I went to Golden to do some exploring. I asked if we could stop somewhere for coffee since that’s my jam and so we took to exploring the downtown area of Golden for that sweet sweet caffeine hit.

We had a few options but Red Silo won since I was looking for a more traditional coffeehouse versus some place that just served coffee. So, we dipped in and got in line for some espresso delish.

But! Their espresso machine was currently broken so I was heartbroken to not get my usual americano. With that depressing news, I had to think quick for something else. I settled on a cold brew and eyed the delicious-looking baked goods in the display case as Cassey placed her order.

While you can sit in and enjoy your coffee, we were on an adventure so we took our drinks to-go. Plus with all the foot traffic coming and going, it might not be the most relaxing place to sip and sit.

The cold brew was pretty decent. My brain is pretty hardwired for americanos so it took a few sips to adjust to the cold brew but once I did, it was pretty tasty. Not my usual cup of…. tea but not bad overall. Maybe adding some flavor to this would’ve kicked it up a notch since I was out of my norm but it was pretty decent and did it’s job.

The baristas were super friendly and accommodating to trying to make the drinks people wanted besides us. Having a broken espresso machine must be stressful for the staff but the baristas took it in stride and did great.

If you find yourself wandering around Golden and need some coffee for your walk, Red Silo will get you jittery.', '2025-03-28 17:06:23.811', '2025-03-28 17:06:23.811'),

We ordered Panuchos Benedict, Tacos de Castecán, Churros, mimosa and French press coffee. The eggs benedict were delicious, with a generous amount of meat and hollandaise sauce. The overall taste was wonderful and well-seasoned. The taco with pork belly was tasty, with cheese and mango habanero salsa that paired perfectly with the pork. We also loved the churros for dessert, especially since they were served with two types of sauces: dulce de leche and chocolate. I also ordered the French press coffee, which was excellent.

This is what we ordered…

Guacamole - served with tostada chips.  The guac was tangy and yummy.
Tuna Crudo - this was an explosion of flavor in your mouth.  It was sweet from the strawberries and oh so delicious.
Tuna Tostada - also so incredibly flavorful.  This was one of my faves.
Duck Panucho - this was pretty hearty
Camarones - the shrimp had a tangy flavor with the mangoes.  Seemed a bit overcooked and dry.
Lubina Pohchuc - the sea bass was super yummy as well.
Dulce de leche flan - the dessert was not too sweet and just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth.

The intimate atmosphere is what I imagine an underground 1950s jazz club was like minus the cigarette smoke!  The set was almost completely the quartet''s own compositions interspersed with stories and annecdotes and their passion for the music was obvious.

Guests ranged from late teens (my son) to retired couples and people from several nationalities.  Drinks were reasonably priced (we didn''t try the food because we had already eaten) and it was a relaxing and cool (in a jazz sense) way to spend a few hours.  We will definitely be back.

Our adventurous-with-food 3 year old wanted sushi for dinner so this was the only option. Even at 5pm, there was a wait for a table, so surely this place must be good, right?

We ordered quite a few dishes to try including the Spicy Miso Soup, Tuna Crispy Rice, Agadeshi Tofu, Black Cod, Big Island Roll, Salmon Maki, Ikura and Scallop Nigiri.

The food, while presented beautifully, was good... In a mediocre way. I would consider this restaurant more a fusion or Japanese-inspired restaurant (catering to a less "diversified" palate) than a true sushi restaurant. Something just didn''t feel authentic about the food we were eating, and all of it being expensive. I mean, $6 for miso soup that tastes just like the instant kind you can buy at your Asian grocery store.

There are great sushi restaurant in Seattle, most are on the expensive side compared to what''s available in places like Vancouver, BC. But when you''re spending $140+ on sushi, there are so many options (Wataru & Shiro).

Probably won''t come here again unless it''s the ONLY option, but in my opinion it was not worth the wait or the price. None of the sushi chefs were Asian (let alone, Japanese) and the majority of the diners were Caucasian, those are usually a good indicator of what the food/experience will be like at an Asian restaurant.

We stopped in for a weeknight dinner and enjoyed all of our drinks and dishes.  Our server was helpful with our questions and attentive throughout our meal.

We split all of our dishes starting with the House Brioche Rolls and Octopus.  The rolls were heavenly and were paired with an incredibly tasty truffle butter.  I don''t know that I would ever skip on those any time I return to Fig.  The octopus was really interesting because it was battered and fried.  We have never had octopus served that way before and it was delicious!  We were a little underwhelmed by the portion size of the octopus for the price, but the flavor was definitely there.

For the entrees, we got the Pappardelle and Black Spaghetti.  The spaghetti was lovely, but we didn''t see any clams.  They might have been incorporated some other way... just wanted to mention that.  For us though, the pappardelle was the start of the meal.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was super interesting.  I''ve never had a pasta dish with horseradish sauce before and I was not disappointed.

I went to Opolis tonight and it was a blast. From what I gather a group of "fascinating and eclectic young individuals" have shown enterpreuneuship and taken ownership of this club in the recent past and are putting together a unique vision into action. This is a good place for entertainment at University of Oklahoma - good people, good times and great experiences.

I was a bit early and got introduced to these owners and it was the begining of the wonderful experience.
- I had the delicious house Pineapple punch with rum which was excellent and just one glass put a "buzz in my turban"
- I got to see the menu and noticed a yummy array of food but did not eat as I had already eaten my dinner! Will be there tomorrow to eat!
- The ambience of the place reflects on the warmth and friendly nature of the ownership! The bar was well stocked and well kept, the premises were very clean and there was a sense of pride in what was being done. The outside patio was very charming!
- The service was impeccable and as I mentioned in the earlier paragraphs there could not be a friendlier place! Thank you Addi, Lane, Eli, Sarah, Ethan and Julius for looking after me so well. You people are going to go places.

To summarize, I had an excellent experience on the above these three categories and I will be going to the dance party on the 3rd!! I strongly recommend this venue for anybody''s entertainment needs and a place to get together with friends!

As far as entertainment- there was an out of state "modern country western band," Tommy Goodroad and his band, and it was their first gig in Oklahoma. It was excellent stuff played by a very talented band with the artists playing a whole spectrum of originals and cover music.

Hope to see you all at the Opolis sometime soon. Have a great weekend!!

It is the closest to me otherwise I''d go elsewhere and probably will from now on. I noticed another bad review on here about roaches. I did get one in a milkshake once from here. Their twist frozen yogurt is always different sizes. What I mean is there is no consistency, we''ll order 2 of the same thing but they will clearly be disproportionate. When we point it out we get treated like we''re in the wrong or dumb. This time we got one small cup twist and it was more like a mini. We were told to pull up and wait for the food being cooked, but it was cold when we ate it (we do not live that far). The burgers were made with the ingredients just pilled in one spot.  The kids burger was ordered as a burger with only ketchup, pickles and tomato, but it came with cheese anyway. My granddaughter does not like cheese but they seem to do that every time. Since we were not in front of the service window we just pulled away and didn''t check these things till we got home. Some of us started eating before realizing this and we did not want to go back. So my wife called, being tired of the poor quality and upset with the errors, hoped to inform the manager expecting he would offer to make things right. The manager, Kevin, treated her rudely and did not want to compensate, but only tell her to bring the food back. He eventually and reluctantly agreed to honor something for her next time. After the call he thought my wife hung up but she stayed on listening as he talked trash about her after the call.

I''m thrilled that the Lincoln Manor, closed for three years, is back under new owners!

You can''t go wrong with the appetizer choices: pepper jack cubes got devoured in minutes by our table; the falafel is crunchy and fluffy inside; the bruschetta is excellent: crunchy and fresh; and the portabella strips are a win for anyone who likes mushrooms.
The BLT is crispy and salty and delicious, especially with the excellent battered french fries. The chicken-fried chicken is well-cooked and flavorful; the brown gravy is packed with tasty seasoning. The shrimp scampi could have been drained a little better, but the pasta was nicely done and the shrimp were plump and juicy.

Good creamy sauce not runny like some places. Fantastic taste!

The service was good, the gentleman was very polite and brought me my food. The atmosphere is a nice quiet little hole in the wall restaurant style, good if you want a quiet peaceful lunch.

Only real complaint (which is a very minor one) is I feel the portion size to price ratio is just a tad off. There wasn''t enough meat to justify the $12 price. It was so good that I was disappointed when I ran out lol.

Overall, great spot definitely will return!

The biryani was so fluffy and seasoned beautifully. I added lamb to mine and the lamb was soooo tender and flavorful. I also added some of the yogurt sauce to the biryani and it was so yummy.

The meat samosa were huge and packed full of meat and delicious. The sauces that went with it were phenomenal.

We started off with someone side Ceasar salads, and the lettuce was so fresh and crispy. They come with bread sticks, which are soft with a buttery garlic goodness, it''s like eating a cloud full of flavor. The Ceasar dressing is like an Italian style dressing and it comes with crispy croutons and topped with delicious cheese.
We ordered the bruchetta "sundae," which is served in a cute martini glass and comes with delicious toasted artesian bread. The bruchetta sundae consists of marinated tomatoes, olive oil, balsamic glaze, garlic, and fresh basil.

I have been to Italy, and even the Italians would eat this with fresh mozzarella cheese!

We then ordered the Italian nachos. Ya''ll! It''s like pizza, but on nachos!
The nachos consist of crispy wonton chips topped with Alfredo sauce, crispy pepperoni, Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, Kalamata olives, cheddar, mozzarella, and provolone cheeses. They are garnished with jalapeños, green onions, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze reduction.

For entrees, we ordered a Woodstone pizza, make it your own (build your own). This item was also on the 8 pm happy hour menu. I got the pesto garlic Alfredo sauce, pepperoni, Italian sausage, and chicken. I got extra cheese on top with a side of ranch, but this pizza did not need ranch at all!
The crust was crispy, buttery, and so delicious.

For the second entree, we ordered the shrimp scampi. The angel hair pasta was so flavorful! So buttery and garlicky! The shrimp were succulent and flavorful.

Everything we had was so fresh and delicious! Not to mention the staff are all very sweet and polite!

The happy hour menu consists of several appetizers, pizzas, and alcoholic drinks! We saved over 17 dollars by going to their happy hour! I highly, HIGHLY recommend it!', '2025-03-29 21:49:02.963', '2025-03-29 21:49:02.963'),

I recently visited Tropical Smoothie and had a delightful experience that I can’t wait to share. I ordered the Thai Chicken Salad, and it was nothing short of fresh and delicious. The flavors were vibrant, with a perfect balance of crunch and zest that made each bite enjoyable. It’s clear that they prioritize quality ingredients, and I appreciated the generous portion size as well.

The service was also commendable. The staff was friendly and efficient, ensuring my order was prepared quickly and accurately. It’s always nice to be greeted with a smile and feel valued as a customer.

One of the aspects I particularly enjoyed was the ambiance of the store. It was pleasantly quiet, allowing for a relaxing dining experience. I took advantage of the inviting atmosphere and savored my meal in peace, which is a rarity in many fast-casual dining spots.

Overall, my visit to Tropical Smoothie was a fantastic one.

The Shrimp Tempura Roll was on par with an amateur home made roll and they drowned it in spicy mayo, giving it a soggy texture.

The Tuna Roll and Salmon Roll exist.

The Chicken Teriyaki tastes and feels like microwaved chicken covered in a sauce with a slightly over-wet rice.

I ordered one overpriced yogurt ($13.73!) for takeout.

After I picked up the yogurt and placed it in the cupholder of my car, I noticed the bottom was leaking. There was a crack at the bottom of the cup. I called the store. Little did I know, a lengthy process of gaslighting has begun.

First, denial: There is NO WAY our cup is leaking!

Second hoop: For me to prove the cup was leaking, I had to drive all the way back to the store and bring the leaky cup for them to examine.

After I showed the store the defective cup, the meticulous inspection of evidence has begun. To my shock, the lady from the shop now brought up the store cameras and played back the video and audio of my face with sound -- I had no knowledge I was being video and audio recorded and they''d have my footage forever without consent. She insisted that their cup was not leaking. The problem must be me.

The lady yelled:
"You must have dropped the cup!"
"We have opened the store for a whole year and it is impossible that our cups are defective!"
"There is no way this is our fault!"

I was subject to a ten-minute investigation under the Yomie police. I felt like I walked into a courtroom instead of a yogurt shop.

Of my experience with all the restaurants in Convoy, I have never been treated this poorly as a customer. I have never felt this bad, blamed, gaslighted.

No, I didn''t drop the cup. I didn''t pound the cup on to my cupholder. I didn''t intentionally break the cup so I can spend my entire night driving back to the store embroiled in a meaningless argument just to "scam" a $13 refund out of them.

But the lady wouldn''t let it go until I was beaten into a false confession. Unfortunately, this is not China, where I can bring up all the street cameras with facial recognition and prove to her that I didn''t do so. At least in America (outside of this store), we respect individual privacy.

This interaction has ruined my entire night.

From the moment we walked in, the lively atmosphere and the buzz of happy diners made it clear that this place is a local favorite. A couple walked out as we were walking in and said the food is so good and that we chose a great place! That’s always a good sign.

Under new ownership, Enoteca Adriano is elevating the dining experience while staying true to its beloved menu. One of the new owners stopped by our table to share his vision and commitment to quality, while asking us questions about where we are from and what brought us here. Our conversations added a personal touch that was truly refreshing.

Now, let’s talk about the food! We shared with the rigatoni porcini and the pesto burrata appetizer—both were exceptional. The rigatoni was rich and flavorful, perfectly cooked and complemented by the earthy porcini mushrooms. The pesto burrata was creamy and rich and complemented by fresh tomatoes and artichokes.

The service was impeccable and a testament to their new vision. Our dishes and silverware were replaced between courses, and they even split our meals for us since we were sharing. It’s the little touches like this that make a dining experience truly special.

What impressed us most was the reasonable, family-friendly pricing for such elevated Italian cuisine. Between $40-50 for wine bottles, $15-25 for appetizers, and $25-35 for all entrees. Enoteca Adriano is the perfect spot for both special occasions and casual nights out. I can’t recommend this restaurant enough—this place blew our minds! I can’t wait to return and explore more of their menu.

Their hotdog was also crispy with an amazing chewy dough. Would recommend eating right away for a cheese pull. The cheese cooled down for me by the time I got home. Overall, love that it’s not greasy :)', '2025-03-30 18:26:20.888', '2025-03-30 18:26:20.888'),

This was my first time trying a Korean style fried chicken restaurant and I can’t believe I’ve been sleeping on this!

The menu isn’t too overwhelming but there are plenty of things I would love to try. This time we ordered the garlic soy and the hot and spicy tenders. We opted for the Tikkudak variety which means that after the chicken is fried they put it in the oven and bake it for an extra crispy texture.

The chicken was amazingly crispy and evenly coated in delicious sauce! My favorite was the garlic soy by far! The spicy chicken was hot but not absurdly spicy. I have a reasonably high tolerance for spice so if you are sensitive to it I would be careful! This was one of the few times I’ve had fried tenders when I didn’t feel the need to sink them in ranch. I’ll absolutely come back as I want to try some of the other flavors.

The people that run the restaurant are also super friendly and welcoming! I love local restaurants like this! Highly recommended!', '2025-03-30 18:26:20.888', '2025-03-30 18:26:20.888'),

It’s rich in flavor and texture. The meat is more juicy than my previous go to (Boom Boom and Bon Chon) in the area. The staff is super welcoming and friendly.

With that said, these wings are pretty good. I live down the road so it''s an easy pickup compared to making the walk or drive down to MaMa''s. How do they compare? Different flavors for sure, wing size here is larger given the price difference between the two chains, breading is similar but slightly different. While you get more bang for the buck at MaMa''s, support your local businesses and stop by because of their variety. My go to flavor is the red hot pepper, if you are not a hot ones enjoyer, be aware because it''s actually spicy; significantly more than the spicy garlic. The kick reminds me of ghost pepper but I could be wrong. The spicy garlic was good but something about it keeps me from re-ordering it.

We ordered a variety of dishes: Beoseot Kalguksu, 蘑菇刀切面 (Noodles Soup with Mushrooms), Maesaengi Kalguksu, 海藻面, (Noodles with Seaweed fulvescens), Deulkkae Kalguksu, 紫苏刀切面, (Noodles Soup with Wild sesame), and a Seafood and Green Onion Pancake. The portions were more than generous between the three of us. We each ended up taking half of our soup bowls home.

What I appreciate is that when you order the large noodle soup, they give you a separate small dish to cool down your noodles since the soup comes straight from the stove and is incredibly hot!

Each of the noodle soups stands out for its knife-cut noodles and unique, complex broths. The Mushroom Noodle Soup had a distinct umami flavor, with potatoes adding a starchy texture and a subtle heat in the seasoning. The Seaweed Noodle Soup was particularly notable for its seaweed and shredded cucumbers, which added freshness. It also had a slight kick of spice, which was a nice surprise. The Noodle Soup with Wild Sesame was the most indulgent. It had a rich, Alfredo-like sauce that coated the noodles perfectly. A touch of white pepper and ground sesame seeds gave it a lovely nutty flavor.

As for my favorite, the Seafood and Green Onion Pancake was sublime. It was loaded with seafood and green onions, though I wish it had been a bit crispier. The sauce served with it was tasty, but I prefer a bit more heat. Thankfully, they provided two 2 oz containers: one with jalapeños and the other with a spicy gochugaru-based sauce so I could adjust the heat to my liking.

The service was friendly, and while the place is cozy, it’s best suited for smaller groups. If you''re dining with more than four people, seating might be tricky.', '2025-03-30 18:40:53.802', '2025-03-30 18:40:53.802'),

Luckily I’ve never waited for a table but the place is always busy and the bowls all come out piping hot.

I’ve been hesitant to give this restaurant a chance. The restaurant does not look appealing and menu options are too broad. That’s a red flag and I was questioning their quality even before I tried.

Boy, was I wrong! I only tried three items - knife noodle anchovy based, chicken based and steamed dumpling. They were all superb and the red sauce and diced Serrano pepper paired so perfectly. Two kinds of kimchi were perfectly seasoned and fermented. And the serving lady was extremely hospitable.

My conclusion. Halmae is the 2nd best Korean knife noodle restaurant in the Tri-state and the best one in NJ.', '2025-03-30 18:40:53.802', '2025-03-30 18:40:53.802'),

Look at the thinly sliced piece of Kimbob. It’s huge and stuffed. Yet it’s sliced so thinly that it’s still a bite size. It takes a lot of skills to accomplish this feat.
