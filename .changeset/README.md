# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Emoji Map Changeset Workflow

In the Emoji Map project, we use changesets to track and document changes to our codebase. This helps us maintain a clear history of changes and automate the versioning process.

### Creating a Changeset

When you make changes to the codebase, you should create a changeset to document those changes. We've created a custom script to make this process easier:

```bash
pnpm changeset:create
```

This interactive script will prompt you to:
1. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
2. Provide a description of the changes

Alternatively, you can use the standard changeset command:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

### Types of Changes

- **Major** (Breaking): Changes that break backward compatibility
- **Minor** (Feature): New features that don't break existing functionality
- **Patch** (Fix): Bug fixes and minor improvements

### Versioning

When it's time to release a new version, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset:version
```

This command will:
1. Bump the version number based on the changesets
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md file
3. Remove the changeset files that were used

### Best Practices

- Create a changeset for each significant change
- Write clear, concise descriptions that explain the change and its impact
- Include relevant issue or PR numbers in your descriptions
- Create changesets as part of your PR process, before merging
